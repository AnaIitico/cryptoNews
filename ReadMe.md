6. Overview

    This site is our front end project for our cohort. Our group decided to focus on Crypto currency. With all the market swings and uptick in news coverage we figured it would be a great idea to have a one stop shop site for leading Blockchain news and education on market current conditions. With the rapid pace of growth, more and more people are interested in learning more, learning positives, learning negatives or just staying up to date with current events in this ever changing market. Encrypto is designed to give you all of this.

    * This is the code to fetch ticker symbol, Listening for the menu selection, Store the ticker symbol in local storage, open results page onLoad(), display results. Change color of sentiment based on the value (neutral, positive, negative)


            const newsMenu = document.querySelector('.dropdown-menu');
            const sentimentMenu = document.querySelector('.sentiment-menu');
            newsMenu.addEventListener("click", e => {
                e.preventDefault();
                if(e.target.id === "BTC" || e.target.id === "ETH" || e.target.id ==="XRP"){
                    localStorage.symbol = e.target.id; 
                    window.location.href = "results.html"
                }
            })
            function displaySymbol(){

                let symbol = localStorage.symbol;
                // if(localStorage.symbol == undefined || localStorage == null ? "BTC" : localStorage.symbol)
                let urlSymbol = `https://cryptonews-api.com/api/v1?tickers=${symbol}&items=50&token=${APIKEY}`;

                fetch(urlSymbol)
                .then(apiData1 => apiData1.json())
                .then(symbolData => {

                    symbolArray = symbolData;
                    // console.log(`This is symbolArray`);
                    // console.log(symbolArray.data.length);

                    let fontColorTitle = "";
                    let fontColor = "";
                    let fontSize = "18px";
                    let fontSize1 = "18px";
                    let count = 0;

                    while(count < symbolArray.data.length){
                        let sentimentColor = "goldenrod"
                        if(symbolArray.data[count].sentiment == "Positive"){
                            sentimentColor = "dodgerblue";
                        }
                        else if(symbolArray.data[count].sentiment == "Negative"){
                            sentimentColor = "red";
                        }
